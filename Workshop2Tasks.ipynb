    "\n",
    "In Week 1 we looked at the fundamentals of computation, and introduced you to basic constructs used within Python. These consisted of basic data types, control flow structures (if, elseif, else), boolean expressions, and loops (for, and while).\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we looked at building upon this by exploring functions, and how they can wrap common procedures that we might want to execute multiple times. We expanded upon the concept of “everything is an object” and looked at abstraction and decomposition and how we can use these when constructing and representing data in our programs to make code more reusable, readable, and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind this workshop is about discovery, and experimentation surrounding topics covered so far.\n",
