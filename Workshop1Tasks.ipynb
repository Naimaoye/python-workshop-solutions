    "\n",
    "The aim of this session is to introduce you to the Python Interpreter and Jupyter Notebook environment, which we’ve briefly seen this week. This workshop will serve as an introductionto Python, putting into practice all that we’ve covered this week. It is important to take time to understand these basic concepts, and explore what they can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please see ‘Useful Information’ below on how to lookup certain Python functionality. The concept behind this workshop is about discovery, and experimentation surrounding topics covered so far. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Python Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "https://docs.python.org/3.8/\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to lookup core language features of Python 3.8 as well as tangential information about the Python Language. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter itself offers some basic documentation for people new to the editor. These can be found on \n",
    "\n",
    "https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.html \n",

    "## Running A Jupyter/IPython Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions showing Jupyter Notebook installation, is available on Canvas under.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a server which runs on the local machine. It will use whichever directory it is invoked within as the root folder. It is then able to see all sub-folders within that. This is currently installed on the lab machines; however, if you are wishing to install this at home, you may need to follow pip instructions for installing jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook can be launched from the command line by invoking:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a server, typically on ​http://localhost:8888/tree​, and should automatically open a new tab in the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebook server uses a token, generated at launch, to authenticate access. By default, the notebook server is accessible to anybody with network access to your machine over the port, with the correct token.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are asked for a password or token, you can always invoke:\n",
    "\n",
    "    jupyter notebook list\n",
    "    \n",
    " This will provide you a list of currently active Notebook servers (you can run multiple, on different ports, for different folders), along with their token, all within a single URL.\n",
    " \n",
    "### PIP and packages\n",
    " \n",
    " PIP is python’s packaging tool, it enables the installation of libraries. If you tried to import pandas when starting your notebook, you may have noticed that it gives you an error. This is because, by default, pandas is not installed within the super lab.\n",
    " \n",
    " Python has a rich community backing, with several libraries available over at PyPI which users can install. Users can even make their own libraries and host them online for others to use.\n",
    " \n",
    " If you require to install python packages within the Fenner Labs​, the image we have is not an administrator. Therefore installing packages to the system level is not permitted. However, pip provides a --user flag for installing packages to the user-profile instead.\n",
    " \n",
    " Most packages can be installed by using\n",
    " \n",
    "     pip install packageName\n",
    " \n",
    " Remember, you can always use `pip help install` for specific help information on installing."

This is achieved by stepping through the entire list, comparing the current element to the next in the sequence. If the current element is greater than the following one, they are swapped in-place. The loop then continues until all elements are exhausted. The effect of this is that the largest number will bubble up through the list to the top. Once we’ve reached the top, we start the comparison again for a second pass, third pass, fourthpass, etc. This is repeated until the list is sorted. I.e. no swaps have occurred that pass.\n",
